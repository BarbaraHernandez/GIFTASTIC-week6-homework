Week 6 Homework - using GIPHY API to serve up dog GIFs

About my App:

About my Code: The most important part of this code is the array. We need to be able to populate buttons on the page using the contents of the array. We need to make sure that those buttons are functional in that they use GIPHY API to populate GIFs to the designated div. Finally, we need ensure that we can continue to add to the array from the app and have those new entries also populate functioning buttons. I think about in this order:
    1. Create array - done, easy
    2. Create buttons from array - done, easy
    3. Populate GIFs using buttons
    4. Append to the array from the DOM

Our GIFs also need to load in a static state and play when clicked, going static again if clicked again.
